Dr. Marchio is a Ph.D. specializing in Environmental Sociology, providing her with a high level of expertise for reading and understanding research reports and statistical findings.  No special considerations are anticipated for communicating the study results to Dr. Marchio.  She, in turn, would be able to then discuss any pertinent information with others in the community.

In addition, the National Park Service fundamentals program is sponsored by the Workforce Management Learning and Development Office.

All new permanent employees must complete the training program within the first two years of service.

To achieve professional and personal goals, the National Park Service provides employees with leadership and technical training, as well as orientation programs.
