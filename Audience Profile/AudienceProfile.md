## Sociodemographics 

#### Training & Education (Personal)

Dr. Marchio is a Ph.D. specializing in Environmental Sociology, providing her with a high level of expertise for reading and understanding research reports and statistical findings.  No special considerations are anticipated for communicating the study results to Dr. Marchio.  She, in turn, would be able to then discuss any pertinent information with others in the community.

In addition, the National Park Service fundamentals program is sponsored by the Workforce Management Learning and Development Office. This program focuses on all the new permanent employees of NPS to help them develop a complete foundational understanding of their organization, workforce, values, and mission. The new permanent employee must complete the training program within the first two years of service. The program includes both online and residential courses. Two of the residential courses require an official trip that can be covered using a government charge card, which is offered by the NPS Fundamentals Program. One course is weeklong in Washington, D.C., and the other is a two weeks course in Grand Canyon, Arizona. Some online courses are required to be completed before the residential courses, which required a computer and time to complete.

National park employees must be alert and reactive to their training and developmental needs. To achieve professional and personal goals, the National Park Service provides employees with leadership and technical training, as well as orientation programs. NPS provided opportunities to its employees to develop and improve their skills so that they can perform their best with their abilities. National Park Service believes in career development more than formal training.
