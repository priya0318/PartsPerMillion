### Background & General Description – Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve

Located in the state of Louisiana just southwest of New Orleans is the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve.  The area where the park is located is called the Barataria Preserve and consists of wetlands, swamps, forests and prairie land that cover over 26,000 acres of the southern Mississippi River delta.  The park was first established as a state park in 1966 by the State of Louisiana.  Later, in 1978, the United States Congress designated the park as the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve.  The area is named after Jean Lafitte, a rather infamous character who resided in and dominated the area in the early 1800s.  The stated mission of the park is to preserve the natural and cultural resources in and around the Mississippi River delta region.

Jean Lafitte operated a rather questionable business in the Barataria region in the early 1800s.  Mr. Lafitte was engaged in smuggling both goods and slaves into the United States through Louisiana when the country had prohibited the importation of African slaves, as well as most goods, from England and France during the Napoleonic wars.  He was considered a pirate by the authorities until 1814 when the War of 1812 came to southern Louisiana.  Mr. Lafitte was then enlisted to help Andrew Jackson turn back the British forces at the Battle of New Orleans, which was fought primarily at the Chalmette Plantation & Battlefield, and is now part of the park.  At this time, Mr. Lafitte and his men all earned pardons for their smuggling activities, and most settled into New Orleans or the Barataria area. The final whereabouts of Mr. Lafitte is a mystery.

The other important population in the Barataria area is today known as the Cajuns.  During the late 1600s, migration of many settlers from rural western France formed in what is today known as Nova Scotia.  At the time, this was known as Acadie, and the people were the Acadians.  In 1755, the British decided to disperse the Acadians to several locations in and around the Caribbean.  In the early 1800s, as many as 4,000 of these people found their way to the Barataria area.  Over the years their culture, language, and food evolved to what we now refer to as Cajun.

The Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve is tasked to preserve both the natural resources of the Barataria region, as well as the history and culture of those that inhabited the area.  The park has six distinct sites, including the Barataria Preserve, the Chalmette Battlefield, the Acadian Cultural Center, the Prairie Acadian Cultural Center, the Wetlands Acadian Cultural Center, as well as the visitor center in the French Quarter of New Orleans.  For purposes of our study, we will focus on the Barataria Preserve and the natural resources, habitat, and wildlife contained within the preserve.

The Barataria Preserve invites visitors to explore the area via nine different hiking and walking trails.  These vary in length and difficulty to complete, with some being handicapped accessible, and others for more robust hiking.  The trails include the Bayou Coquille  Trail, the Marsh Overlook Trail, the Visitor Center Trail, the Palmetto Trail, the Ring Levee Trail, the Wood Duck Trail, the Plantation Trail, the Old Barataria Trail, and the Twin Canals Trail.  For purposes of this study, data observations were taken over time along four of these different trails.

Inside the Barataria Preserve, the area is teaming with wildlife.  There is a wide array of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and insects found within the park’s boundaries.  Mammals may include armadillos, squirrels, rabbits, minx, coyote, and white-tail deer.  Tree frogs, green anoles, and water snakes are plentiful, as are American alligators.  After 30 years of protection, the alligator population is healthy and thriving.  Over 200 species of birds call the Barataria Preserve their home, using the vegetation and waterways for foraging, nesting, and resting.  Fish, crabs and other aquatic life are also found on the preserve, as are numerous varieties of insects.

The Barataria Preserve is also home to a wide variety of plant life and foliage.  The Barataria Preserve contains three major plant systems: hardwood forest, swamp, and marsh.  There are over 400 different species of plants found on the preserve.  In the spring, wildflowers are abundant throughout the area, with one of the most stunning being the giant blue iris population.  In summer, the freshwater marsh turns bright green, highlighting systems of reeds, sedges, grasses, and shrubs.  Fall is colorful at the preserve, with brilliant red maples and bright yellow bur-marigolds.  As the preserve covers both wetlands and prairie areas, the vegetation may differ greatly from region to region within the park.

One concern at Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve is the effects of increasing climate change.  Melting polar ice means rising seas everywhere, including along Louisiana's Gulf Coast. Stronger storms flood more coastline and erode more land.  To make it worse, the levees and other flood controls along the Mississippi River and other waterways mean that no new land is being built on the delta. Much of the region's land is from sediment deposited by the river over time.  The natural compression and sinking of the sediment-made land go on with no new soil washing downstream by seasonal floods. Recent studies have shown that as the land is sinking while the seas are rising, the relative sea levels are rising faster in this area than most places.  Another concern with the changing climate is its effect on the phenology of the region.  In the next section of this document, the description and concerns for the changing phenology will be outlined.


## Research Questions

Based on an analysis of both the metadata and the dataset, it is proposed that this report concentrates on descriptive statistics for the different organisms documented in the data.  The primary research questions proposed are as follows:

* What is the time of year when the phenological event begins for the different organisms grouped by categories?

* What is the length of time observed for the phenological event for the organisms, again grouped by categories?

* Did the timing and/or duration of the phenological event change significantly for any of the organisms during the three years of observations?

* For those organisms that are found in multiple regions, are there differences in the timing and/or duration of the phenological events?

The answers to these questions may be important for a number of reasons.  Visitors to the park may be interested in viewing some of the phenology events in progress as they visit the park.  The location and timing of these events may be important for them to plan their visit.  Also, by looking at the results, if there seems to be a change in the timing of the phenology events, then perhaps additional study would be warranted to attempt to determine possible causes for the timing changes.

## The Study Organism

### Barataria Phenology Trail

### Introduction
Phenology is all about the biological events and the timing that they recur. It is mainly the study of the causes of timings of such events and the interrelations among the phases of the same of distinct species. Like for example, we can observe different phenological patterns with the climatic changes in the temperate zones. (Ewusie 1992; van Schaik et al. 1993; Zimmerman et al. 2007). 

### Barataria Preserve
It is outside Marrero and offers a taste of Louisiana's wild wetlands. The area of this preserve covers around 26,000 acres. It preserves a representative example of the delta’s environment, containing natural forests, bayous, swamps, and marshes.

### Classification
The trail may be classified into two categories based on the kingdom type. Plantae and Animalia would be the two taxonomic kingdoms where the data were recorded. 

### Blue Iris:
The major plant systems in this preserve are hardwood forest, swamp, and marsh. In spite of the fact that the blue iris population was reduced for a few a long time, they appear to be making a comeback.

Kingdom: Plantae

Genus/Species: Iris giganticaerulea

Common Name: Giant Blue Iris

Height: Can reach up to 6 feet

Color: pale blue to deep indigo

These plants were widespread throughout the state before the wetlands were drained for agriculture. The Iris can be spotted in swamps and marshes along the Barataria preserve. The unique vertical leaves of the iris enable the plant to receive the most amount of sunlight in tightly packed iris colonies, providing plenty of energy for photosynthesis. 
The rhizome of the iris contains a strong, acrid resin that is used by herbalists for therapy of continual vomiting, heartburn, liver, scrofula, skin diseases, and migraines. The iris used to be on occasion recognized as the “pneumonia plant” because a sturdy tea made from the rhizomes was used as a treatment for pneumonia. 

### American Alligator:

Kingdom: Animalia

Genus/Species: Alligator mississippiensis

Common Name: American Alligator

Speed: 30 miles/hr

Habitat: freshwater swamps, marshes, and rivers

The Barataria Preserve could be an incredible place to spot all sorts of Louisiana critters.  The preserve has most of the crawling reptiles and amphibians in which the American alligator is the most attention gained species. In the past, these alligators were hunted until their extinction but then we can see them back again because of the protection and management.  

### Barred Owl:

Kingdom: Animalia

Genus/Species: Strix varia

Common Name: Barred Owl

Other names: Hoot Owl or Eight Hooter

Size: Female barred owls are larger and heavier than male barred owls. Their length ranges from 40 - 63 cm and tail length range from 312-380mm.

Habitat: deep moist forests  

Barred Owls are spotted in the Barataria Preserve in almost all of the seasons. There are only a few birds that can be spotted in all seasons and Barred Owl is one among them. This barred owl is also known to be alive 23 years in captivity and around 24 years in the wild forest. The young owls develop their wings in four to five weeks after hatching. Since they are non-migratory, the nests are reused again. The horned owl seems to be the most efficient predator. They use the nests created by the woodpeckers, crow or hawk in the tree cavity.


## The kind of decisions, interventions, or actions that analysis results could support

Based on the research questions posed above, some of the potential actions from the results may include:

* The development of visitor information to inform the public about the timing of the phenology events.  For instance, answering questions like "what is the best time to see the iris bloom?", or "when is the fall foliage the most spectacular?", or "what is the best trail to view a particular bird species?".  The park could develop printed materials, update website content, and train staff members to answer some of these questions for the park visitors.

* If the results of the research questions show differences for the phenology events, either by location or in their timing, then one could ask the question "why is this happening?".  This could lead to another set of studies, with enriched data, to attempt to establish a correlation between the observed changes and a change in some other variable (e.g. rainfall, temperature, elevation, growing days, etc).  If further study can establish a correlation, then one could go further to look for causality.

* Similarly, if the research questions show differences in timing or location for the phenology events, then one could also ask "what else might this affect?".  This could again lead to another set of studies to look at other organisms and how they relate to the phenology event (e.g. total populations of species, changes in population, changes in population activities, etc).  As before, the additional study could look for correlations first, and if found, then attempt to look for the causality.
