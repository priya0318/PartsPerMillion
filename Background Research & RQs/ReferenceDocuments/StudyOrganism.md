## Background Research Report: The Study Organism

### Barataria Phenology Trail

### Introduction
Phenology is all about the biological events and the timing that they recur. It is mainly the study of the causes of timings of such events and the interrelations among the phases of the same of distinct species. Like for example, we can observe different phenological patterns with the climatic changes in the temperate zones. (Ewusie 1992; van Schaik et al. 1993; Zimmerman et al. 2007). 

### Barataria Preserve
It is outside Marrero and offers a taste of Louisiana's wild wetlands. The area of this preserve covers around 26,000 acres. It preserves a representative example of the delta’s environment, containing natural forests, bayous, swamps, and marshes.

### Classification
The trail may be classified into two categories based on the kingdom type. Plantae and Animalia would be the two taxonomic kingdoms where the data were recorded. 

### Blue Iris:
The major plant systems in this preserve are hardwood forest, swamp, and marsh. In spite of the fact that the blue iris population was reduced for a few a long time, they appear to be making a comeback.

Kingdom: Plantae

Genus/Species: Iris giganticaerulea

Common Name: Giant Blue Iris

Height: Can reach up to 6 feet

Color: pale blue to deep indigo

These plants were widespread throughout the state before the wetlands were drained for agriculture. The Iris can be spotted in swamps and marshes along the Barataria preserve. The unique vertical leaves of the iris enable the plant to receive the most amount of sunlight in tightly packed iris colonies, providing plenty of energy for photosynthesis. 
The rhizome of the iris contains a strong, acrid resin that is used by herbalists for therapy of continual vomiting, heartburn, liver, scrofula, skin diseases, and migraines. The iris used to be on occasion recognized as the “pneumonia plant” because a sturdy tea made from the rhizomes was used as a treatment for pneumonia. 

### American Alligator:

Kingdom: Animalia

Genus/Species: Alligator mississippiensis

Common Name: American Alligator

Speed: 30 miles/hr

Habitat: freshwater swamps, marshes, and rivers

The Barataria Preserve could be an incredible place to spot all sorts of Louisiana critters.  The preserve has most of the crawling reptiles and amphibians in which the American alligator is the most attention gained species. In the past, these alligators were hunted until their extinction but then we can see them back again because of the protection and management.  

### Barred Owl:

Kingdom: Animalia

Genus/Species: Strix varia

Common Name: Barred Owl

Other names: Hoot Owl or Eight Hooter

Size: Female barred owls are larger and heavier than male barred owls. Their length range from 40 - 63 cm and tail length range from 312-380mm.

Habitat: deep moist forests  

Barred Owls are spotted in the Barataria Preserve in almost all of the seasons. There are only a few birds that can be spotted in all seasons and Barred Owl is one among them. This barred owl is also known to be alive 23 years in captivity and around 24 years in the wild forest. The young owls develop their wings in four to five weeks after hatching. Since they are non-migratory, the nests are reused again. The horned owl seems to be the most efficient predator. They use the nests created by the woodpeckers, crow or hawk in the tree cavity.
