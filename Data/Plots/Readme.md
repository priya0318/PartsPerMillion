This directory contains the PDF and PNG files created by the GGPLOT.R code, also found in this directory.  Note that the R code must be run several times, changing the SpeciesDesc to select the proper observations, and the proper labeling on the output.  Each plot contains the detail for each species (except Birds, which are all done together).  The plots show the timing of various phenophase activity for each species, with faceting by year and site identified by color.  The line segments are from "first yes" to "last yes" when both of those observations were present in the data.  The dots show the "last no" and "first no" at the start and end of the phenophase, respectively.

These plots should be able to answer pretty much all of our research questions, although I also want to create some interval data (time lapse in days) and create some bar charts to compare durations of phenophase activity.  This will have to wait for another day, however.

Added four new sets of plots focusing on specific phenophases across species.  These include Breaking Leaf Buds, Falling Leaves, Colored Leaves, and Open Flowers.  Also added R code for these plots, and divided the R code into 2 files with the code for plots either by Species or by Phenophase.
