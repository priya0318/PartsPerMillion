## Jean Lafitte National Park and Preserve â€“ Research Questions

Based on an analysis of both the metadata and the dataset, it is proposed that this report concentrates on descriptive statistics for the different organisms documented in the data.  The primary research questions proposed are as follows:

### Research Questions

* What is the time of year when the phenological event begins for the different organisms grouped by categories?

* What is the length of time observed for the phenological event for the organisms, again grouped by categories?

* Did the timing and/or duration of the phenological event change significantly for any of the organisms during the three years of observations?

* For those organisms that are found in multiple regions, are there differences in the timing and/or duration of the phenological events?

The answers to these questions may be important for a number of reasons.  Visitors to the park may be interested in viewing some of the phenology events in progress as they visit the park.  The location and timing of these events may be important for them to plan their visit.  Also, by looking at the results, if there seems to be a change in the timing of the phenology events, then perhaps additional study would be warranted to attempt to determine possible causes for the timing changes.

### Potential Actions

Based on the research questions posed above, some of the potential actions from the results may include:

* The development of visitor information to inform the public about the timing of the phenology events.  For instance, answering questions like "what is the best time to see the iris bloom?", or "when is the fall foliage the most spectacular?", or "what is the best trail to view a particular bird species?".  The park could develop printed materials, update website content, and train staff members to answer some of these questions for the park visitors.

* If the results of the research questions show differences for the phenology events, either by location or in their timing, then one could ask the question "why is this happening?".  This could lead to another set of studies, with enriched data, to attempt to establish a correlation between the observed changes and a change in some other variable (e.g. rainfall, temperature, elevation, growing days, etc).  If the further study can establish a correlation, then one could go further to look for causality.

* Similarly, if the research questions show differences in timing or location for the phenology events, then one could also ask "what else might this affect?".  This could again lead to another set of studies to look at other organisms and how they relate to the phenology event (e.g. total populations of species, changes in population, changes in population activities, etc).  As before, the additional study could look for correlations first, and if found, then attempt to look for the causality.
