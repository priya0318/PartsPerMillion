## Jean Lafitte National Park and Preserve â€“ Research Questions

Based on an analysis of both the metadata and the dataset, it is proposed that this report concentrates on descriptive statistics for the different organisms documented in the data.  The primary research questions proposed are as follows:

### Research Questions

* What is the time of year when the phenological event begins for the different organisms grouped by categories?

* What is the length of time observed for the phenological event for the organisms, again grouped by categories?

* Did the timing and/or duration of the phenological event change significantly for any of the organisms during the three years of observations?

* For those organisms that are found in multiple regions, are there differences in the timing and/or duration of the phenological events?
