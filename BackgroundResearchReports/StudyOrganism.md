## Background Research Report: The Study Organism

### Barataria Phenology Trail

### Introduction
Phenology is all about the biological events and the timing that they recur. It is mainly the study of the causes of timings of such events and the interrelations among the phases of the same of distinct species. Like for example, we can observe different phenological patterns with the climatic changes in the temperate zones. (Ewusie 1992; van Schaik et al. 1993; Zimmerman et al. 2007). 

### Barataria Preserve
It is outside Marrero and offers a taste of Louisiana's wild wetlands. The area of this preserve covers around 26,000 acres. It preserves a representative example of the delta’s environment, containing natural forests, bayous, swamps, and marshes.

### Classification
The trail may be classified into two categories based on the kingdom type. Plantae and Animalia would be the two would be the taxonomic kingdoms where the data were recorded. 

### Blue Iris:
The major plant systems in this preserve are hardwood forest, swamp, and marsh. In spite of the fact that the blue iris population was reduced for a few a long time, they appear to be making a comeback.

Kingdom: Plantae

Genus/Species: Iris giganticaerulea

Common Name: Giant Blue Iris

Height: Can reach up to 6 feet

Color: pale blue to deep indigo

These plants were widespread throughout the state before the wetlands were drained for agriculture. The Iris can be spotted in swamps and marshes along the Barataria preserve. The unique vertical leaves of the iris enable the plant to receive the most amount of sunlight in tightly packed iris colonies, providing plenty of energy for photosynthesis. 
        The rhizome of the iris contains a strong, acrid resin that is used by herbalists for therapy of continual vomiting, heartburn, liver, scrofula, skin diseases, and migraines. The iris used to be on occasion recognized as the “pneumonia plant” because a sturdy tea made from the rhizomes was used as a treatment for pneumonia. 

### American Alligator:

Kingdom: Animalia

Genus/Species: Alligator mississippiensis

Common Name: American Alligator

Speed: 30 miles/hr

Habitat: freshwater swamps, marshes, and rivers

The Barataria Preserve could be an incredible place to spot all sorts of Louisiana critters.  The preserve has most of the crawling reptiles and amphibians in which the American alligator is the most attention gained species. In the past, these alligators were hunted until their extinction but then we can see them back again because of the protection and management.  

### Barred Owl:

Kingdom: Animalia

Genus/Species: Strix varia

Common Name: Barred Owl

Other names: Hoot Owl or Eight Hooter

Size: Length 40-63 cm. Wingspan 96-125cm. Tail length 312-380mm. Weight 500-1050g. Females are normally larger and heavier than males.
Habitat: deep moist forests  

Barred Owl could be spotted in all seasons in the Barataria Preserve. There are only few birds which can be spotted in all seasons and Barred Owl is one among them. The barred owl's nest is often in a tree cavity, often ones created by pileated woodpeckers; it may also take over an old nesting site made previously by a red-shouldered hawk, Cooper's hawk, crow, or squirrel. It is a permanent resident, but may wander after the nesting season. If a nest site has proved suitable in the past they will often reuse it as the birds are non-migratory. In the United States, eggs are laid from early-January in southern Florida to mid-April in northern Maine, and consist of 2 to 4 eggs per clutch. Eggs are brooded by the female with hatching taking place approximately 4 weeks later. Young owls fledge four to five weeks after hatching. The most significant predator of barred owls is the great horned owl. Eggs, juveniles, and occasionally adults are vulnerable. The barred owl has been known to live up to 24 years in the wild and 23 years in captivity
