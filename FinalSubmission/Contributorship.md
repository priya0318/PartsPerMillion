# Change Log
We encountered two significant changes in the process as outlined below.

## Data Cleaning - missing YES values
As we went through the data cleaning process, we discovered many observations with missing values for last YES or first YES values.  This caused us to add a new data column to group observations by duration, which would show the extent of the problem.  We then created a histogram plot to visually show this problem with possibly incomplete data.

## R-Plotting - feedback from peers
While we still wanted to include our five-dimensional phenophase timing plots, many of our peers thought it too complex.  We took another look, and decided to create a mean table and bar chart to compare phenophase start times and durations, which would be a simpler look to help answer some of our research questions.  This was added to the very end of the project in the final submission.
